# Detect Breast Cancer With Machine Learning

The project is to use three Machine Learning algorithms to detect breast cancer (malignant or benign). An evaluation of the accuracy is done to determine which algorithm is best suited for predicting a diagnosis. The prediction is then compared to the actual results to determine of the trained model's accuracy.

Writen in Python -- it makes use of the powerful libraries that enables Machine Learning to be what it is today.
